# Examples of Nextflow pipelines

*Yu Wan*



This repository contains my pipelines created for practice and training purposes. Often in this repository I only include files that were manually modified for system compatibility or a specific analysis. Click each subdirectory for details. An adaptation is often necessary when migrating these pipelines to other platforms since components of every pipeline may be system-dependent.



**System configuration**

- Python 3.5
- Nextflow 19.01.0.5050
- FlowCraft 1.4.1



**Abbreviations**

- High-performance (computer) cluster (HPC)
- Protable batch system (PBS)
